  During the last decades, information security has become a major issue. 
  Encrypting and decrypting data have been recently investigated and developed widely because there is a strong demand for encryption and decryption which is very hard to crack. 
  Cryptography plays major role to fulfil these demands. 
  Now a days, many of the researchers have proposed many of encryption and decryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), 
  DES (Data Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and others, 
  but most of the proposed algorithms encountered some problems such as lack of robustness and significant amount of time added to packet delay to maintain the security on the communication channel between the terminals.
  “A New Approach for Complex Encrypting and Decrypting Data” which maintains the security on the communication channels by making it difficult for the attacker 
  to predicate the pattern as well as speed of the encryption / decryption scheme.
  Simply, encryption is the process of encoding a message or data in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. 
  Therefore, decryption is the process of connecting the encrypted data back to its original form for the receiver understanding.
EXISTING SYSTEM
  In the evolving world of data and information transfer, security of the file contents remain to be one of the greatest concerns for companies. 
  Some information can be password protected (emails, logins) while other information being transferred via emails or FTP lacks efficiency if protected by some keyword.
  This is where file encryption plays a big role and provides security and convenience sought by parties engaged in file transfers.
PROPOSED SYSTEM
  We all work on the internet, we communicate through the internet, and want our data and information should be secured,
  and it is done by cryptography. Cryptography prevents the other user and attackers from accessing our confidential data and information.
  The two essential functionalities of cryptography are encryption and decryption. 
3.1 Project prerequisites
  To implement this project, we will use the basic components of Python like Tkinter, pybase64 libraries.
  Tkinter is standard GUI Python Library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
  The base64 module in python provides functioning for encoding and decoding text or binary data to ASCII and vice-versa respectively.
  To install the required libraries, you can use the pip install command:

  pip install tk
  pip install pybase64

3.2 Objective
  The main objective of this project is to convert the plaintext into ciphertext and convert the ciphertext into plaintext .
